# A Data-driven Classification and Prediction of Gentrification in NYC

**Authors:** Mingkai Deng, Yvonne Zhou, Jerry Shi

**Summary:** 

- We examined the effectiveness of [NYU Furman Center's classification](http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/new-report-analyzes-new-york-citys-gentrifying-neighborhoods-and-finds-dram) of the gentrifying stages of NYC neighborhoods using [NYC housing and neighborhoods data provided by the Center](http://app.coredata.nyc). 

- To enhance the original classification, we proposed an approach using the hierarchical clustering method, and selected the number of clusters using the gap statistic metric. 

- We used information from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) to construct leading predictors for gentrification based on our classification, controlled for variables commonly associated with gentrification. 

- Based on the insights, we made our predictions for NYC's next hotspots for gentrification. 

**Outcome:** Best Insight Award in Columbia DataFest 2018
